	<1 idle_hurt talk>Precisely!
	<1 idle_hurt talk>Your soul is but baggage weighing down your being.

[12]
{
	<1 idle_angry annoyed>And then answer me this:

	<0 sad idle_annoyed>I...
	<0 sad idle_annoyed>Why can't I?
	<0 sad idle_annoyed>I kept repeating their names over and over the entire way here.
	<1 idle_sad annoyed>Is that really why you're here?
	<1 idle_sad annoyed>Are you sure you didn't stumble into this hotel by mistake?
	<1 idle_sad clever>You certainly wouldn't be the first.
